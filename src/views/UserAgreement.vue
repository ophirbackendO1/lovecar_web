        <p>Welcome to Love Car, a service provided by Ophir IT Solutions. By accessing or using our application and
            related services ("Service" or "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms").
            If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.</p>

        <h4>1. General Conditions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract in your country of residence
                to use the Service.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service at any time, without prior notice.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for all communication charges incurred by your use of the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Subscriptions</h4>
        <h4>2.1 Premium Subscription</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Some features of the Service ("Premium Features") require a paid subscription ("Subscription").</li>
            <li>Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring monthly or annual basis ("Billing Cycle"), managed by
                Google Play or Microsoft Store ("Store").</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each Billing Cycle unless canceled.</li>
            <li>Cancellation of the Subscription can be done through the Store. Your Subscription remains valid until
                the end of the current Billing Cycle.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions may require a Google account for authentication with the Love Car Backend Service
                ("Backend Service").</li>

                of Premium Features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2.2 Trial Subscriptions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Some Subscriptions offer a trial period, granting access to Premium Features before the first payment.
            </li>
            <li>If not canceled before the end of the trial, you will be automatically billed for the Subscription.
                Canceling before the trial ends will prevent any charges.</li>

            <li>You can terminate your Subscription by disabling the auto-renewal in the Store.</li>

                deleted within 90 days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2.4 Fee Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ophir IT Solutions may modify Subscription fees at any time. Changes will take effect at the end of the
                current Billing Cycle.</li>
            <li>You will be notified in advance of any fee changes. Continuing to use the Service after the change
                signifies your agreement to the new fees.</li>
        </ul>
