      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>Last Updated on August 27, 2024.</p>

      <h4>1. Information we collect</h4>
      <p>
        When you register for a LoveCar account or correspond with us, we may ask you to
        provide certain information such as your username, profile picture, first and last
        name, phone number, city, state, and email address. We also collect any messages
        or feedback you send us through the Service, as well as information about your
        mobile device (such as IMEI, brand, and model).
      </p>
      <p>
        We use the IMEI number and model to help limit the creation of multiple accounts
        from a single device. This allows us to provide a more secure and consistent user
        experience by preventing abuse or fraudulent activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, if you register a Business Account as an automotive business owner,
        we collect business-related information, including your business name, address,
        location, categories, products and services offered, and business contact
        information. You can manage this information within your account, and it is used
        to facilitate the features and services of the LoveCar platform, such as allowing
        customers to find and review your business.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use the information you provide, including your contact details and device
        data, to operate, maintain, and improve the features and functionality of the
        Service, to communicate with you, and to address any issues or concerns you raise
        about the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose not to provide your personal or business information, you may not be
        able to access or use all of our Service features, and your overall experience may
        be diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously. All
        data is stored and transmitted using industry-standard encryption protocols to
        protect against unauthorized access or misuse.
      </p>

      <h4>2. Information we receive from third-party applications</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to the information you provide directly to us when creating a LoveCar
        account, we also collect certain data from third-party applications and services
        that you choose to connect to your LoveCar account.
      </p>
      <p>
        One such integration is the ability to create a LoveCar account using your
        existing Google account. When you select this option, we will collect your Google
        User ID (UID), your Gmail email address, and the username associated with your
        Google account. This information allows us to quickly and securely set up your
        LoveCar account without requiring you to manually enter all of your personal
        details.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use this third-party account information solely for the purpose of establishing
        and maintaining your LoveCar account. We do not share or use this data for any
        other purpose without your explicit consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        All information collected from third-party applications, including Google, is
        stored and protected with the same industry-standard encryption and security
        measures as the data you provide directly to us. We will never sell or distribute
        your third-party account information to any unaffiliated parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to disconnect your third-party account integration at any time, we
        will promptly remove all associated data from our systems, in accordance with our
        data retention and deletion policies outlined in the "Account Deleting" section.
        Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about our use of
        information from third-party applications. We're committed to being transparent
        about our data practices and ensuring the privacy and security of your personal
        information.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Business Account Features</h4>
      <p>
        With a Business Account, automotive business owners can manage their business
        information on the LoveCar platform. This includes adding and updating business
        categories, services, and other relevant details. Business Account users can also
        view customer reviews and engagement metrics, such as the number of views their
        business profile receives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business owners can assign additional roles, such as Admin and Co-Admin, to other
        users, allowing them to manage the business profile collaboratively. Additionally,
        businesses created by the LoveCar Admin Team can be linked to your account for
        easier management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information managed through a Business Account is visible to other LoveCar users,
        including potential customers, and is used to facilitate business discovery and
        customer interactions on the platform.
      </p>

      <h4>4. Location Access</h4>
      <p>
        Our app requires access to your device's location in order to provide certain
        features and functionalities. Specifically, we use your location information to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Detect your current location and display nearby gas stations, car workshops, and
          other automotive-related businesses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide directions and navigation assistance to help you find the closest
          relevant locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offer location-based recommendations and suggestions based on your proximity to
          certain services or amenities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We collect your location data using the device's built-in GPS, Wi-Fi, or cellular
        network positioning capabilities. This information is used solely for the purposes
        described above and is never shared with third parties without your explicit
        consent. You can manage your location permissions at any time by going to your
        device's settings menu and adjusting the location access settings for our app. If
        you choose to disable location access, some features of our app may become
        unavailable or may not function as intended. We take the privacy and security of
        your location data very seriously. All location information is stored and
        transmitted using industry-standard encryption and security protocols to protect
        against unauthorized access or misuse. If you have any further questions or
        concerns about our use of location data, please don't hesitate to contact our
        support team.
      </p>

      <h4>5. Content within your account</h4>
      <p>
        Our Service allows you to create and manage information about your car, such as
        fuel costs, maintenance expenses, income, and other relevant data. We collect and
        store this information in our database to provide the full functionality of our
        app and to help you track and analyze your automotive-related finances and
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our app currently supports two main user roles: Owner and Driver. As an Owner, you
        can create and manage detailed information about your vehicle(s). As a Driver, you
        can track your driving-related expenses and activities for any car you've been
        authorized to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Business Accounts, owners can manage their business information, services, and
        customer interactions as described above. The information you provide, including
        your contact details, device data, and car or business-related content, is used to
        operate, maintain, and improve the features and functionality of the Service, to
        communicate with you, and to address any issues or concerns you raise about the
        Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose not to provide your personal information or car-related data, you
        may not be able to access or use all of our Service features, and your overall
        experience may be diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously. All
        data is stored and transmitted using industry-standard encryption protocols to
        protect against unauthorized access or misuse.
      </p>

      <h4>6. Keeping your information safe</h4>
      <p>
        LoveCar cares about the security of your information, and uses appropriate
        safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected
        through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable
        steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before
        granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the
        secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling
        access to your email communications from LoveCar, at all times. However, LoveCar
        cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to LoveCar
        or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed,
        altered, or destroyed.
      </p>

      <h4>7. How long we keep your information</h4>
      <p>
        Following termination or deactivation of your user account, LoveCar will retain
        your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time, and
        for as long as we have a valid purpose to do so. In particular, LoveCar will
        retain your information for the purpose of complying with its legal and audit
        obligations, and for backup and archival purposes.
      </p>

      <h4>8. Account Deleting</h4>
      <p>
        Our app offers an account deletion feature, which allows you to request the
        removal of your LoveCar account and all associated data. When you submit a
        deletion request, we will retain your account information for a certain period of
        time (e.g., 14 days) before permanently deleting it. During this time, you can
        choose to discard your deletion request if you change your mind. Once the
        retention period has elapsed, your account and data will be deleted, and this
        action cannot be undone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer this feature to respect your right to privacy and give you control over
        your personal information. If you decide to delete your account, we will
        permanently remove all of your data, including any car-related content, from our
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that if you have an outstanding balance or unresolved issues with our
        service, we may need to retain some of your information for a longer period to
        address those matters. We will always strive to respect your privacy and delete
        your data as soon as possible, while also ensuring we can properly address any
        outstanding obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns about the account deletion process, please
        don't hesitate to contact our customer support team. They'll be happy to assist
        you and provide more information about our data retention and deletion policies.
      </p>

      <h4>9. Notifications and Communications</h4>
      <p>
        As part of our service, we may send notifications and other communications to our
        users to provide important information, updates, and features.
      </p>
      <p>
        These notifications can be sent to all users, or targeted to specific user groups
        or individual accounts, depending on the nature of the communication. Some
        examples of the types of notifications we may send include:

        <li>Alerts about potential issues or problems with your connected vehicle</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The content and frequency of these notifications will vary, but we aim to strike a
        balance between providing valuable information and avoiding excessive or
        disruptive messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will never sell or share your contact information (email, phone number, etc.)
        with third-party advertisers or marketing companies. All notifications and
        communications from LoveCar will be directly related to the services and features
        we provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns about the notifications you receive, please
        don't hesitate to reach out to our customer support team. We're committed to
        ensuring our communications are helpful, relevant, and respectful of your
        preferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time to reflect our current practice and
        ensure compliance with applicable laws. When we post changes to this policy, we
        will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy. If we make any
        material changes to the way we collect, use, store and/or share your personal
        information, we will notify you on our website or by sending an email to the email
        address associated with your LoveCar account. We recommend that you check this
