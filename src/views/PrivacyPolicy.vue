            <h5>Privacy Policy (Love Car)</h5>
            <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on July 08, 2024.</p>

            <h5>1. Information we collect</h5>
            <p>When you register for a LoveCar account or correspond with us, we may ask you to provide certain
                information
                such as your username, profile picture, first and last name, phone number, city, state, and email
                address.
                We also collect any messages or feedback you send us through the Service, as well as information about
                your
                mobile device (such as IMEI, brand, and model).</p>
            <p>We use the IMEI number and model to help limit the creation of multiple accounts from a single device.
                This
                allows us to provide a more secure and consistent user experience by preventing abuse or fraudulent
                activity.</p>
            <p>We also use the information you provide, including your contact details and device data, to operate,
                maintain, and improve the features and functionality of the Service, to communicate with you, and to
                address
                any issues or concerns you raise about the Service.</p>
            <p>If you choose not to provide your personal information, you may not be able to access or use all of our
                Service features, and your overall experience may be diminished.</p>
            <p>We take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously. All data is stored and
                transmitted using industry-standard encryption protocols to protect against unauthorized access or
                misuse.
            </p>

            <h5>2. Information we receive from third-party application</h5>
            <p>In addition to the information you provide directly to us when creating a LoveCar account, we also
                collect
                certain data from third-party applications and services that you choose to connect to your LoveCar
                account.
            </p>
            <p>One such integration is the ability to create a LoveCar account using your existing Google account. When
                you
                select this option, we will collect your Google User ID (UID), your Gmail email address, and the
                username
                associated with your Google account. This information allows us to quickly and securely set up your
                LoveCar
                account without requiring you to manually enter all of your personal details.</p>
            <p>We use this third-party account information solely for the purpose of establishing and maintaining your
                LoveCar account. We do not share or use this data for any other purpose without your explicit consent.
            </p>
            <p>All information collected from third-party applications, including Google, is stored and protected with
                the
                same industry-standard encryption and security measures as the data you provide directly to us. We will
                never sell or distribute your third-party account information to any unaffiliated parties.</p>
            <p>If you choose to disconnect your third-party account integration at any time, we will promptly remove all
                associated data from our systems, in accordance with our data retention and deletion policies outlined
                in
                the "Account Deleting" section. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about our use
                of
                information from third-party applications. We're committed to being transparent about our data practices
                and
                ensuring the privacy and security of your personal information.</p>

            <h5>3. Location Access</h5>
            <p>Our app requires access to your device's location in order to provide certain features and
                functionalities.
                Specifically, we use your location information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect your current location and display nearby gas stations, car workshops, and other
                    automotive-related businesses.</li>
                <li>Provide directions and navigation assistance to help you find the closest relevant locations.</li>
                <li>Offer location-based recommendations and suggestions based on your proximity to certain services or
                    amenities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We collect your location data using the device's built-in GPS, Wi-Fi, or cellular network positioning
                capabilities. This information is used solely for the purposes described above and is never shared with
                third parties without your explicit consent. You can manage your location permissions at any time by
                going
                to your device's settings menu and adjusting the location access settings for our app. If you choose to
                disable location access, some features of our app may become unavailable or may not function as
                intended. We
                take the privacy and security of your location data very seriously. All location information is stored
                and
                transmitted using industry-standard encryption and security protocols to protect against unauthorized
                access
                or misuse. If you have any further questions or concerns about our use of location data, please don't
                hesitate to contact our support team.</p>

            <h5>4. Content within your account</h5>
            <p>Our Service allows you to create and manage information about your car, such as fuel costs, maintenance
                expenses, income, and other relevant data. We collect and store this information in our database to
                provide
                the full functionality of our app and to help you track and analyze your automotive-related finances and
                activities.</p>
            <p>Our app currently supports two main user roles: Owner and Driver. As an Owner, you can create and manage
                detailed information about your vehicle(s). As a Driver, you can track your driving-related expenses and
                activities for any car you've been authorized to use.</p>
            <p>We also use the information you provide, including your contact details, device data, and car-related
                content, to operate, maintain, and improve the features and functionality of the Service, to communicate
                with you, and to address any issues or concerns you raise about the Service.</p>
            <p>If you choose not to provide your personal information or car-related data, you may not be able to access
                or
                use all of our Service features, and your overall experience may be diminished.</p>
            <p>We take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously. All data is stored and
                transmitted using industry-standard encryption protocols to protect against unauthorized access or
                misuse.
            </p>

            <h5>5. Keeping your information safe</h5>
            <p>LoveCar cares about the security of your information, and uses appropriate safeguards to preserve the
                integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and
                security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before
                granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique
                password
                and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from LoveCar, at all
                times.
                However, LoveCar cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to LoveCar or
                guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>

            <h5>6. How long we keep your information</h5>
            <p>Following termination or deactivation of your user account, LoveCar will retain your profile information
                and
                User Content for a commercially reasonable time, and for as long as we have a valid purpose to do so. In
                particular, LoveCar will retain your information for the purpose of complying with its legal and audit
                obligations, and for backup and archival purposes.</p>

            <h5>7. Account Deleting</h5>
            <p>Our app offers an account deletion feature, which allows you to request the removal of your LoveCar
                account
                and all associated data. When you submit a deletion request, we will retain your account information for
                a
                certain period of time (e.g., 14 days) before permanently deleting it. During this time, you can choose
                to
                discard your deletion request if you change your mind. Once the retention period has elapsed, your
                account
                and data will be deleted, and this action cannot be undone.</p>
            <p>We offer this feature to respect your right to privacy and give you control over your personal
                information.
                If you decide to delete your account, we will permanently remove all of your data, including any
                car-related
                content, from our systems.</p>
            <p>Please note that if you have an outstanding balance or unresolved issues with our service, we may need to
                retain some of your information for a longer period to address those matters. We will always strive to
                respect your privacy and delete your data as soon as possible, while also ensuring we can properly
                address
                any outstanding obligations.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the account deletion process, please don't hesitate to
                contact
                our customer support team. They'll be happy to assist you and provide more information about our data
                retention and deletion policies.</p>

            <h5>8. Notifications and Communications</h5>
            <p>As part of our service, we may send notifications and other communications to our users to provide
                important
                information, updates, and features.</p>
            <p>These notifications can be sent to all users, or targeted to specific user groups or individual accounts,
                depending on the nature of the communication. Some examples of the types of notifications we may send

            </ul>

                providing
                valuable information and avoiding excessive or disruptive messages.</p>
            <p>We will never sell or share your contact information (email, phone number, etc.) with third-party
                advertisers
                or marketing companies. All notifications and communications from LoveCar will be directly related to
